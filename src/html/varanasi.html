    <div class="product-description">
        The ghats along the Ganges River are the heart of Varanasi. Witness the spiritual rituals, ceremonies, and bathing rituals that take place at sunrise and sunset. Most of the ghats in Varanasi were rebuilt in the 18th century under the maratha patronage. The patrons of current ghats are Marathas, Shindes (Scindias), Holkars, Bhonsles, Peshwes (Peshwas), and Maharajas of Benares. Many ghats are associated with legends or mythologies while other ghats have private histories and users. A morning boat ride on the Ganges along the ghats is a popular visitor attraction.

      <div class="product-description">
        Attend the mesmerizing Ganga Aarti ceremony at Dashashwamedh Ghat, where priests perform rituals with fire lamps, incense, and chants.
        Every evening, priests of Varanasi perform an elaborate and extremely beautiful aarti on the ghats of Ganga. The most prominent of these ghats is Dashashwamedh Ghat which is located right next to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. The other ghats where people can watch the Varanasi aarti are Assi Ghat and Rajendra Prasad ghat.At Dashashwamedh ghat, one moment there's hustle-bustle about finding the perfect place to watch the aarti, and the other moment the entire city falls silent when a shankh (conch) is blown. The shankh heralds that the aarti is beginning and it draws everyone's attention. Since the Ganga aarti of Banaras is for the River Ganga, a statue of Goddess Ganga is placed in the centre at one of the many raised platforms. With the sound of bells and chants and lighting of incense sticks and diyas, the aarti is carried on.
